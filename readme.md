# 🎓 School_stuff — C++ Concepts in Practice

> A hands-on journey through C++ fundamentals with a focus on **Classes**, **Streams**, and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

This repository serves as a sandbox for practicing C++ programming through structured examples and experimental mini-projects. It’s built around core C++ topics that are critical for understanding modern software development in C++.

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

This repository includes categorized folders containing focused examples on:

### 🔹 Classes and Objects
C++ is an object-oriented language at its core. The `Classes/` folder contains:

- **Basic class syntax**: Declaring and defining classes
- **Encapsulation**: Using `private`, `public`, and `protected` access modifiers
- **Constructors and Destructors**: Managing object lifecycle
- **Getters and Setters**: Accessor and mutator methods for clean design
- **This Pointer**: Understanding how objects refer to themselves
- **Static members**: Shared variables and functions between instances

📂 *Folder: `Classes/`*

### 🔹 Streams and File I/O
The `Streams/` folder explores C++’s powerful stream-based I/O:

- **Using `cin` and `cout`**: Standard input and output
- **File streams (`fstream`)**: Reading from and writing to files
- **String streams (`stringstream`)**: Useful for data parsing and conversions
- **Binary vs Text I/O**: Understanding file formats and modes
- **Error handling in streams**: Checking and clearing stream states

### 🔹 Test_Stuff — Experimental Ideas
The `Test_Stuff/` folder contains:

- Mini snippets and "what-if" code
- Isolated logic testing
- Examples for understanding syntax, memory, pointers, references, and other isolated C++ concepts
